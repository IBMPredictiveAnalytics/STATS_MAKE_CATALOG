<h1>STATS MAKE CATALOG Extension Command</h1>

<p>Create and activate a dataset whose cases are variable names and labels 
and, optionally, selected attributes from one or more data files.</p>
<div class="syntax">
<p>STATS MAKE CATALOG <em>list-of-specifications</em><sup>&#42;</sup> </p>

<p>/OPTIONS FILETYPES=SPSS<sup>&#42;&#42;</sup> SAS STATA<br/>
DSNAME=<em>name</em><br/>

<p>HELP.</p>

<p><sup>&#42;</sup> Required<br/>
<sup>&#42;&#42;</sup> Default</p>

<p>/HELP displays this text and does nothing else.</p>

<p><strong>list-of-specifications</strong> is a list of one or more filenames, optionally with paths, and/or directories.<br/>
For directories, all appropriate files in the directory and its subdirectories are searched.
File handles are supported.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p><strong>FILETYPES</strong> Choose one or more file types.  It defaults to SPSS files (.sav and .por).
sas files are .sas7bdat, .sd7, .sd2, .ssd01, .ssd04, and .xpt<br/>
stata files are .dta.</p>

<p>Files with any of the specified types found in the directories specified are searched.  Since 
these files are opened in SPSS, if the same file is already open in SPSS, it will be reopened 
without saving any changes that may have been made.</p>

<p><strong>DSNAME</strong> optionally specifies a dataset name to be assigned to the output dataset.
If not given, a name will be created.</p>

<p><strong>FILENAMEPATTERN</strong> can be specified as a quoted literal containing a regular expression pattern
starting from the beginning of the name
to be used as a filter on filenames.  For example, <code>FILENAMEPATTERN=&quot;car&quot;</code> would limit the 
files searched to those whose name starts with &ldquo;car&rdquo;.  <code>FILENAMEPATTERN=&quot;.*car&quot;</code> would accept 
any filenames containing &ldquo;car&rdquo;.  These are not the same as filename wildcards found in many operating systems.
For example, <code>&quot;abc*&quot;</code> will match any name starting with ab: it means literally ab followed by zero or more c&#39;s.
The search is anchored at the start of the string.
To search for a pattern anywhere in the string, write it as <i>.*ab</i>
The regular expression is not case sensitive, and it is applied to the name of the 
file without the extension.  For a full explanation of regular expressions, one good source is

  <p><strong>VARNAMEPATTERN</strong> Optionally,
  enter a regular expression to limit the catalog to names matching a
  regular expression pattern.  The search is anchored at the start of the string and is not case sensitive.</p>

<h2>ATTRIBUTES</h2>

<p><strong>list-of-names</strong>
specifies a list of custom variable attributes to be included in the output dataset.  The variable 
names will be the attribute names except if they conflict with the built-in variables <em>source</em>, 
<em>VariableName</em>, and <em>VariableLabel</em>. If the attribute is not present, the value will be blank.<br/>
If the attribute is an array, only the first value is included.
Attribute variables in the output dataset are truncated to the length specified in <strong>ATTRLENGTH</strong>, 
which defaults to 256 </p>
